After her mother passes when she was 11 Gabrielle went to an orphanage where she learned to sew.in 1902 she left the covnant and became a seamstress she also performed as a cafe singer. This is where she got her name Coco. </p>
        <p> In 1912 she opened her first boutique in Deauville France. She started with selling jersey into practical and elegent designs which were inspired by menswear. Many influential and wealthy women were attracted to this style because of the discomfort of the corseted styles.</p>
        <h2>Take Off</h2>

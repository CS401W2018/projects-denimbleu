        <p>Sadly in 2010 Alexanders mother passed away. This broke Alexander's heart and just one day before her funeral Alexander was found. He had found it to hard to go on. Many were devasted by his passing and proud of what he had acomplished. Having come from a poverished family and rising to riches and never having shyed away from that aspect, he had shown the world that through hard work and dedication anything can truly be done. </p>

This is where he met Yves Saint Laurent. They would become very good friends. Before this point Karls last name had a T at the end but he decided to remove it due to making his name more commercial. Soon after this a French designer named Pierre Balmain hired Karl.</p>

        <p>Unlike Karl who worked his way to the top, Saint Laurent was quickly hired by Chirstion Dior shortly after meeting Karl. When Dior passed away in 1957 Saint Laurent was chosen to take over. When the war broke out he served his time. When he got back in 1961 he discovered Dior had fired him. He won a lawsuite against them and founded his house and named it after himself.  </p>
        <p>Beginning in the late 70's Karl and Saint were competeing in the fashion world for the peoples love of designs. While Saint would take a riskier way and look to design for the future, Karl liked to take more of a dive into a classier older style.

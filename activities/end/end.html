        <p>1. The Title of my site will be called All About Fashion. The topic will be about famous fashion designers and what they did to the fashion industry</p>
        <p>2.The reason I chose this topic is because I have always been a huge fan of fashion and the fashion industry. Ive actually worked in the fashion industry before in LA and in NY and would love to do so more in the future. I love looking at the way different designers show their work. I think that fashion is another way people express themselves. Each runway is an art gallary and each design is an artpiece. </p>
        <p>3. The title page will go over a brief overveiw of the fashion industry and then a table listing the types of designs and designers. Then each of the other pages will be focused on a different designer and their top works and runway moments.</p>
        <p>4. The information I will collect will be design names, collection names and times. The information that is going in table is the designer names their most famous peices, their start debut and end debut. Their peak time. </p>
        <p>5. One of the sites is forbes magazine and another is britanica</p>
        <p>I have read the warnings and acknowledge them. I will not use ChatGPT or another AI system to generate HTML, CS, or content on my page.</p>

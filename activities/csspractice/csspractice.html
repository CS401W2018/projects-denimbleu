        <p>How we select a tag is first by the tag name. We also can use something called the ID: ID is uniqe it is like nameing someone, you cant reuse, usually a noun. Another way is a class: a class  we use a period infront of it, we can reuse it, usually an adjective. 1  tag can have more than one class </p>
        <p class="second">Heres a <span class = bolder>very cool</span>trick to get your page to upload, you need to click on the page hold and press command r also empty cashes. </p>
        <p>A div tag will get create a box and everything in the box is affected and a span tag only does a section or a few words.</p>
        <p>colors can use a hashtag  or a RGB values.</p>

        <p>What you learned about Flex and CSS. I learned that flex uses a box model to start and then procedes to save it out correctly to how you design. I learned about the different ways to use flex such as flex-direction, jusify-content, and flex-flow.</p>
        <p>Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean? It means that the website has to accomidate and work with devices that accomidate all people. It is actually illigal to make and use something without it being accessible. It is a legal requirment if you start a buisness.</p>

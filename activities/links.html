    <p>An Absolute link will always work, its considered easy. Relative  links, link to your website only. They are "related to us" </p>
    <p>Three rules to remember is 1. period means what folder you are in/the current folder 2. two periods means parent folder or to go up a folder 3. the / means start at the root.</p>
    <p>Links do not always need to be in the nav but if they are anywhere else they will not show up when the page changes</p>

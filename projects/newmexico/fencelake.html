        <p class="lake">Fence Lake New Mexico is even a smaller erea the the rest of the towns listed. It is by far much less of a town and more of a wide spread commmunity. Here they have one post office and a small church for the people of Fence Lake to come to. The people here are often either lineman workers and most are off grid. They either send their kids to the small school located in Quemado, or homeschool their children. </p>

    <p>Donna  Tartt is an amazing Author, the way she writes really capitivates the audience and makes you feel as if you are really there and in the story. She is amazing at portraying the feelings of the main character, Richard, while also later in the books making you question if he even is a good person. Donna Tartt also has wrote some other amazing novels throughout her life but the Secret History is most   definently the one that stands out to me in my mind. Here is a list of books she has written.</p>

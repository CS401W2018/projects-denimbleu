        <p id="second">My favorite book of all time is <span class="italic">The Secret History by Donna Tartt.</span> This book overall follows around 5 college students who choose to study greek together. They go through ups and downs in the book but throughout the book we start to wonder  who the real enemy is. Its a mystery but also could be described as dark academia. It really makes you think about life and contemplate human nature. </p>
        <p class="third">The Reason that I am comparing the two books, The Secret History and If We Were Villians, is because if you read these two books you will start to relize that these books are extreamly similiar in plot. I do indeed enjoy both ofthese books but I feel as if the books each have their own undertone to them. If We Were Villian takes on  a more happy and carefree feeling at the begining and I would say ends in a much more devastating way, while The Secret History takes on more of a classical literatureundertone and ends in a more solomn way. </p>

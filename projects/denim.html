    <h1>All About Denim Bleu</h1>
    <p>I come originally from a small town out in the middle of nowhere New Mexico. Its called <em>Pie Town</em>, and the people there are indeed very proud of their pies. There actually is a celebration called pie festival that happens there every year, they just celebrated it last week in fact. My family owns a cattle ranch there and we have ran it for over 5 generations. Growing up in a small town really made me relize that as much as I loved my friends and family there, I wanted to travel and see the world, expereince new things. This is part of what drove me to come to school all the way here in Hawaii. </p>
    <p>I would describe myself as being a pretty well rounded person and am able to enjoy many different hobbies. One of my favorite hobbies is snowbording. I do really love to just get on my board put my headphones in and go down the mountain. I also am a huge reader! I read everything and anything. I developed this skill when I was young and have been able to keep it up my entire life. My favorite book is <cite>The Secret History</cite> writen by <cite>Donna Tartt.</cite> </p>

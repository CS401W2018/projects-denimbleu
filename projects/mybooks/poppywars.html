            <p>The Poppy War series is a unique twist on Chinese history, especially focusing on the English takeover of China, but it also weaves in some really cool elements of Chinese mythology. It’s a work of fiction, so there are no real historical figures in it. The main character, Rin, comes from a super poor town and is an orphan, which makes her story even more compelling.</p>
            <p>One professor takes a special interest in her, teaching her about ancient monks and the gifts they possessed. As she learns to harness this power, she uses it to defend the academy when it comes under attack. Rin subsequently joins a small group of soldiers who can also wield similar powers, forming a strong bond with them. </p>
            <p>Rin and her leader end up getting captured, which adds a lot of tension. But Rin isn’t one to give up easily—she manages to escape and goes on a rampage against her captors, showing just how fierce she can be. This summary only scratches the surface of the first book, and the next two continue to explore her journey, filled with even more challenges, growth, and adventures. </p>
